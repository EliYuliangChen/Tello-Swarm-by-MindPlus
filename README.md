# Tello-Swarm-by-MindPlus

## Project Overview

This repository documents the collaborative efforts of myself and two other team members in developing a swarm flight system for Tello TT drones. Utilizing the MindPlus software for drone programming and control, our project showcases the coordinated flight of drone swarms, specifically with formations of 5 and 9 Tello TT drones. 

## Features

- **Swarm Flight Coordination**: Orchestrated flight patterns with 5 and 9 Tello TT drones, demonstrating advanced group control and synchronization.
- **Light Control of Drones**: Implementation of individual and collective light control on drones, enhancing visual appeal and providing status indicators during flight.
- **Precision Flight Map**: Integration of a precise coordinate recognition system in the flight map, ensuring accurate positioning and navigation of each drone in the swarm.

## Technologies Used

- **MindPlus Software**: Utilized for programming the drones, designing flight paths, and real-time control during flight operations.
- **Tello TT Drones**: Advanced drones capable of stable flight and equipped with features suitable for swarm technology and light show coordination.
